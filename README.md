A video Streaming server provides continuous streaming of a video to the client that is requesting for it. Availability of improved and enhanced transmission facilities (i.e. high speed LAN, wireless Ethernet) make it further possible to use video streaming in fast real time applications.
Some of the characteristics of the video streaming server are:

- It allows the user play the video on the go, without waiting for the entire file to be downloaded.
- The video can be Played, Paused, Stopped and Resumed at any time. It uses RTSP protocol for maintaining the session end points.
- Capable of sending payload using RTP.
- The video streaming server can unicast video to a single user requesting for it, broadcast the data to all, or it can multicast it to a group of users at the same time.
